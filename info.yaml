# TinyTapeout project information
#
# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# This will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: "TinyIO takes 7 bits in as digital outputs, and sends 3 bits out from its digital inputs."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "7-bit SPI transaction. Supply nCE, SIN and SCK."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
